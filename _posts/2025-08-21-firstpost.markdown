***Hi!***

My name is Nabil. 

I want to start this whole thing off by saying a few things - first, that I recognize that you and I probably won't agree on a lot of things. The fact of the matter is that I started life off as a rural conservative, and have moved left from there. I certainly don't see things the way you do, and I certainly do not share your view of morality or justice. Oh, and I am Catholic. Pretty staunchly Catholic.

I think that, if I were to draw a series of venn diagrams of my experiences and views, I would end up with a fairly tiny union of the sets. 

Not that it really matters how many people are here with me. 

Anyway, I also want to reserve the right to change my mind. I don't think that people's opinions should stay the same as they grow and change, and I will be damned if I will persecute someone for something they are trying to walk back. I hope you extend to me the same courtesy.
