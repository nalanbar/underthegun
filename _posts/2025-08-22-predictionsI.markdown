From time to time, I am going to make predictions. They are always, always, multi-year predictions unless I specifically state otherwise at the time. 

Mostly, I am posting these to see if I end up right as often as I think I am. Anecdotally, most of the things that have happened in my local city, and many of the things that have happened in the US, I have called, years in advance. 

Not specifically, but more generally- the first order effect of Policy A will be Event B, but the second order effect will be Effect C.
